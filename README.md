# liri-node-app

Liri is a simple bot that will follow four different commands.
    -concert-this
    -spotify-this-song
    -movie-this
    -do-what-it-says

    Each command will query a relevant API to pull information about the band, song, or movie that the user provides. do-what-it-says will read a command from a text file and perform it.

    API's and NPM packages used:
        -bands in town
        -spotify NPM package
        -OMDB
        -axios
        -node fs
